# 0x12-javascript-warm_up

This project is part of a larger course on higher-level programming and focuses on learning the basics of JavaScript.

#### The project consists of several tasks, each with specific objectives.
>> The learning objectives of this project include creating variables and constants, using if, if...else statements, loops, and functions. The project also covers data types, operator precedence, controlling program flow, manipulating dictionaries, importing files, and more.

#### The project has strict requirements, such as
- using semistandard compliant code
- ending files with a new line
- having a mandatory README.md file
- using Node 14 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

#### The tasks require the creation of scripts that print different messages, depending on the number of arguments passed to them or the values assigned to constants.

>> The project also includes a quiz that students must pass to progress to the next level of the course.
